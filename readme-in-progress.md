Grab `dotfiles` from pypi (via pip)
`dotfiles -C /path/to/.dotfilesrc --sync`

Awesome:
* grab vicious and blingbling (maybe I can add these as submodules or include in repo, need to check possibilities/licensing)
* Symlink desired wallpaper to ~/.config/awesome/current-wallpaper
* set AWESOME_TERM environment variable to desired terminal emulator (defaults to xterm)
* Relog / restart awesome.
